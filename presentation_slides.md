## Slide 7: Ethics & Risk Assessment

### Ethical Considerations
✅ **Privacy by Design** - Anonymization before processing  
🔍 **Transparency** - Open-source algorithms, explainable AI  
⚖️ **Fairness** - Equal coverage across all city districts  
🤝 **Consent** - Aligned with user privacy expectations  

### Risk Mitigation
⚠️ **GPS Accuracy Variations** → Multi-resolution H3 analysis  
📱 **Device Bias** → Weighted sampling corrections  
🌦️ **Weather Impact** → Temporal pattern normalization  
🔐 **Data Breaches** → Zero PII storage policy  

### Limitations & Disclaimers  
- Historical analysis only (not predictive)
- Urban canyon effects may impact accuracy
- Seasonal variations require longer observation periods
- Anomalies don't always indicate safety issues
